# 🕒 InTimeRP — Public Development Roadmap
_Last updated: {{10/18/2025}}_

Welcome to the official roadmap for **InTimeRP**, the time-based roleplay experience set in a controlled city economy where every second counts.  
This roadmap tracks our progress across all **four main development phases**, from Phase 1 (Release date scheduled for late december) to full rollout.

---

## 🧩 Phase 1 — Alpha Launch (Core Systems)

> Goal: make the world playable and fun, even with low population.

### ✅ Major Systems 
- [x] **Core Time Mechanic** - Death at no time left
- [x] **Prison System** — jail, mining for time, breakout alerts
- [ ] **Police & Government Roles** — Automatic whitelist
- [x] **Apartment & Real Estate System** — player-owned housing + rent timers
- [ ] Discord Integration — Laws and arrest information
- [ ] Map Creation — rp_southside edited to fit the theme


[!todo] **Socio-economic zoning**



### 🧱 Basic Implementations
- [ ] **Economy & Jobs** — basic earnings + spending
- [ ] **Monetization** — Supporter / Supporter+ tiers
- [ ] **Transaction Logging** — track time trades for 2–4 weeks

### 💰 Core Mechanics
- Players die when out of time (unless revived by medic within 5 min)
- Medics revive using a city budget time - medics will see how they died (multiple gunshot wounds, etc)
- Time bank taxes: any stored time > 24 h taxed 5 %/day 
- Mayor prints time, decides how to budget it


### 🗺️ Map
- [ ] Build prison system inside of map
	- [ ] set up in prison mines
	- [ ] set up prison guard job/cop can switch to this
	- [ ] Multiple ways to escape
- [ ] Build a purgatory for after players die
- [ ] Replace text on map to fit server
- [ ] Zone areas from rich/poor

## 🧾 Phase 2 — Systems Expansion

> Goal: introduce deeper social, criminal, and economic loops.

### 🏛️ New Mechanics
- [ ] **Taxes on banked time** — optional compliance; refusal triggers warrant
- [ ] **NPC Quest Framework** — 30 + quest givers with timed respawns
- [ ] **Expanded Crime System** — new contraband, laundering tiers, bribes
- [ ] **Courier-Dependent Drug Role** — dealers rely on couriers for profit
- [ ] **Player Reputation / Heat System**

### ⚙️ Refinements
- [ ] Better laundering scaling (larger USB = longer time)
- [ ] Repeat offender tracking → longer prison sentences
- [ ] Mayor printing logs → public accountability
- [ ] Enhanced player database → court integration prep
